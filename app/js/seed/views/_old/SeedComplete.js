          We sent instructions for recovering your Blockstack ID with your key
          to the email you signed up with.

        <p>
          Saving your secret recovery key is the most reliable way to recover
          your Blockstack ID. Save your secret recovery key a secret place (we
          suggest writing it on paper). Blockstack IDs are fully decentralized,
          which means anyone who has the secret recovery key effectively owns
          the ID.
